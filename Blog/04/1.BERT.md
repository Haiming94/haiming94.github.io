### BERT Learning ang Using

BERT is a nice job, but unfortunately I learned too late.

Now, let's use [NER-BERT-CRF](https://github.com/Louis-udm/NER-BERT-CRF) from Louis.

- install regex

when I ready for my code and data, but I find that I can't run it with a error which told "No Module named 'regex'", so I try to install it, however, it is not easy.

and in the end, I finally install it with the following cammond:

`python -m pip install regex` from https://github.com/timgrossmann/InstaPy/issues/3449
